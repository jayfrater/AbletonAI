# Standalone Agent Skills

A collection of specialized skill definitions for agentic AI frameworks, focusing on **Ableton Live 12** and **Advanced Computer Use**. Built with google antigravity for this specific use case. 

## Overview

This repository contains Markdown-based skill definitions that can be used as system instructions or RAG sources for AI agents. These skills empower agents to interact with professional audio software and perform complex file system and web-based tasks.

## Skills Included

### 🎹 Ableton Live 12
- **Maestro**: General project control and composition.
- **Sound Designer**: Synthesis and sample manipulation expert.
- **Mixing Expert**: Advanced signal routing and processing.
- **MIDI Master**: Pattern generation and sequencing.
- **M4L Architect**: Max for Live device development.
- **Assistant**: Troubleshooting and workflow optimization.
- **Knowledge Base**: Curated documentation for querying.
- **Project Manager**: Organization and dependency tracking.

### 💻 Computer Use
- **Shell Power User**: CLI proficiency and automation scripts.
- **File System Architect**: Data organization and management.
- **Web Navigation Expert**: Advanced research and tool interaction.

## How to Use

1. **System Instructions**: Copy the content of a .md file directly into your agent's system prompt.
2. **Context Injection**: Use these files as part of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to provide domain-specific knowledge on demand.
3. **Agentic Frameworks**: Integrate with frameworks like PydanticAI, LangChain, or Autogen by loading these skills as tool descriptions or role definitions.
